# Hikma Health Admin Application
The Hikma Health platform is a mobile electronic health record system designed for organizations working in low-resource settings to collect and access patient health information. 
The repository contains the admin web application which is a portal for management of the clinic, its users and patients. Additional functionality can also be added easily.

The platform is designed to be intuitive and allow for efficient patient workflows for patient registration, data entry, and data download. You can see a user demo here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ssBdEPShWCu3ZXNCXnoodbwWgqlTncJb/view?usp=drive_link

This repository contains the client-side code for Hikma Health's administrators application. The corresponding server-side code is located at https://github.com/hikmahealth/hikma-health-backend. Please feel free to file feature requests and bugs at either location.

The admin app is a web only application.
